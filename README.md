#Conway's Game of Life

Explore the fascinating world of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

##Game Rules:

*Underpopulation: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
*Survival: Any live cell with two or three live neighbors continues to the next generation.
*Overpopulation: Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
*Reproduction: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

##Features:

*Play Modes: Navigate forward and backward through generations, or let the game autoplay.
*Grid Customization: Click on tiles to set your initial state, generate a random grid, or clear the entire grid.
*Controls: Zoom in and out, and move through the grid using W, A, S, D keys.

##Future Updates:
In the next version, I plan to introduce pattern options, allowing you to choose and paint various patterns directly onto the grid
